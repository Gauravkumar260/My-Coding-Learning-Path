# 💻 My Coding Learning Path

Welcome to my personal repository where I am documenting my step-by-step journey toward becoming a **Full-Stack Java Developer**.  
This project-based roadmap spans **12–15 months**, covering core programming, data structures, web development, and real-world full-stack applications.




## 📅 Roadmap (Month-by-Month)
- ✅ Month 1–2: Java Basics + OOPs
- 🔄 Month 3–4: DSA with Java
- 🛠️ Month 5–7: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ⚛️ Month 8–9: React.js
- 🌐 Month 10: Node.js + Express.js
- 🗄️ Month 11: MongoDB + API integration
- 💻 Month 12: Full Stack Project
- 🎯 Month 13–15: Resume, Portfolio, Mock Interviews
